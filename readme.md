# REAL ESTATE DATA ENTRY JOB AUTOMATION

# ZILLOW DATA ENTRY BOT

## Problem

Managing large volumes of real estate listings from platforms like Zillow can be a time-consuming and tedious task. Manually entering property details, including addresses, prices, and links, into a Google Form can be particularly cumbersome for clients. Additionally, transferring this data from the form to a Google Sheet for further analysis and organization adds an extra layer of effort and potential for errors.

## Solution

Zillow data entry bot is a bot designed to streamline the process of collecting and organizing real estate listing data from Zillow. The bot automates the following tasks:

1. Data Scraping: The bot utilizes web scraping techniques (Beautiful soup) to extract property details, including addresses, prices, and links, from Zillow's website. It efficiently navigates through multiple listings, capturing the required information in a matter of minutes.

2. Form Filling: Once the data is scraped, the bot automatically populates a Google Form with the collected property details. This eliminates the need for manual data entry, saving significant time and reducing human error in the process.

3. Data Consolidation: After the bot completes the Google Form with the desired listings, the client transfers the form responses to a Google Sheet, with just a click of a button. This allows for easy access, organization, and analysis of the real estate data in a structured and centralized format.

The zillow data entry bot brings efficiency and accuracy to the process of managing real estate listings. It eliminates the manual effort involved in entering data into a Google Form and seamlessly transfers the information to a Google Sheet for further use.
